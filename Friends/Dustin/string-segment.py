"""
Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict,
determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence
of one or more dictionary words.

For example, given
s = "leetcodeone",
dict = ["lee", "leet", "code", "one"].

Return true because "leetcodeone" can be segmented as "leet code one".

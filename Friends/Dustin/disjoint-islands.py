"""
You are given a matrix representing a 2D plain.
0 represents an empty land. A number represents part of an island.
An island consists of cells which can be reached via NSEW directions only.

00000000
00220000
00203000
00040000

In the matrix above, can you tell how many islands are there?
There are 3 islands - numbered 2, 3, 4.
Note that all the islands cannot reach each other via NSEW direction.

=========
If you were to implement an add function add(x, y)
which can convert an empty cell to an island,
could you tell how many islands are there after each add() call.
